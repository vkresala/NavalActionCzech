"ConvertibleItem/Description/559","Angelfish is a conspicuous resident of the reef. The larger species are also quite bold and seemingly fearless"
"ConvertibleItem/Description/560","Barracudas are voracious predators and hunt using ambushes. They rely on surprise and short bursts of speed to overrun their prey, sacrificing maneuverability. They also exhibit some scavenger-like feeding habits."
"ConvertibleItem/Description/561","Bluefishes are fast swimmers which prey on schools of forage fish, and continue attacking them in feeding frenzies even after they appear to have eaten their fill. They are cannibalistic and can destroy their own young."
"ConvertibleItem/Description/562","The cutlassfishes are predatory fishes whose highly carnivorous adults regularly cannibalise younger specimens. They are long, slender, and generally steely blue or silver in colour, giving rise to their name."

"ConvertibleItem/Description/577","The shortfin mako shark is the fastest species of shark. Some cases of shortfin mako jumping into a boat after having been hooked have been reported."
"ConvertibleItem/Description/578","The positioning of the eyes, mounted on the sides of the shark's distinctive hammer head enable them to see above and below at all times."
"ConvertibleItem/Description/579","Snappers are very highly regarded as food fish and demand a premium price."

"Nation/Name/2","España"

Spain has access to uncapturable west Cuba and Vera Cruz areas. These bases are far from enemy activity but the presence of capturable island chains above Havana can cause some trouble for captains leaving the safety of home waters. "
